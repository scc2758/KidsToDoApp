# KidsToDoApp
 
 This app is a collaboration between Sierra Conner, Tyler Dunn, Shaquan Hagans, Tara Ram Mohan, and Sean Youngstone. Our goal is to create a gamified to do app to incentivize elementary-aged children learning from home to complete tasks throughout their day.
 
 Parents assign point-valued tasks to their children, and children can spend accumulated points on in-app rewards ("trophies") that parents may choose to associate with real-world incentives. 
 
 We utilize Google Firebase to store user data and include a password-protected parent mode so that parents and children may interact with the app using a shared device or across multiple devices.
